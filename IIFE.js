/*

Difference Between the Normal Function and IIFE

Normal Function: You define it first and then call it whenever you need to execute the code inside it. You can invoke it multiple times.

function myFunction() {
}
myFunction();
The function can be called at a later time, possibly multiple times


IIFE: It is executed immediately after its creation, and it cannot be invoked again later. It runs exactly onceâ€”right after its definition.

(function() {
  
})();
